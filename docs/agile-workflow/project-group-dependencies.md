- Banks, tech firms, cloud providers or the CDMC are accountable for creating and contributing their own service approval accelerators to Compliant Financial Infrastruture.
- The creation of service approval accelerators is an agile, open source process and not the accountability of the CDMC Technical Spec Working Group.
- Service approval accelerator contributors will be made aware of CDMC documentation and will be accountable for including relevant CDMC Policies and Key Control references.
- When the CDMC service approval accelerator has been created, the document is contributed by pull request to the Compliant Financial Infrastructure repository under and Apache 2 licence.
- The Compliant Financial Infrastructure, Open Compliance for CDMC and CDMC Technical Spec Working Group will review what has been contributed by the open source contributor.
- CDMC Policies and Control references are inherited through the Apache 2 contribution of the service approval accelerator document.
- If the service approval accelerator is ready for development, the pull request is merged into Compliant Financial Infrastructure and passed to Open Compliance for CDMC ready for development.
- If the service approval accelerator is not ready for development, feedback is passed back to the original contributors, changes are made to the pull request, and Compliant Financial Infrastructure, Open Compliance for CDMC and CDMC Technical Spec Working Group review the latest changes.
- The cycle is repeated until the pull request is agreed to be merged.
