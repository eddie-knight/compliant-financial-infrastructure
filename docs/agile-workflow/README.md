# Compliant Financial Infrastructure - Agile Workflow

The Agile Workflow for Compliant Financial Infrastructure falls into four main work streams which are overseen by Compliant Financial Infrastructure, Open Compliance for CDMC and CDMC Technical Spec Working Group maintainers and fulfilled by project teams and wider FINOS community.

1. [Agile Delivery of Prioritised Work Items](#agile)
2. [Community Contributions and Pull Requests](#community)
3. [Compliant Financial Infrastructure Asynchronous Pull Request and Code Reviews](#reviews)
4. [FINOS and CDMC Project Group Dependencies](project-group-dependencies.md)

## <a name="agile">Agile Delivery of Prioritised Work Items</a>

- Compliant Financial Infrastructure and Open Compliance for CDMC are agile projects with agreed agile ceremonies and a fixed sprint cadence. Example agile ceremonies include ...
  - Regular team stand-ups
  - Backlog grooming sessions
  - Pre-sprint planning
  - End of sprint demos
- Sprint cadence is **monthly**, as agreed with the projects, with end of sprint sessions used for team demos and next-sprint planning.
- Middle of sprint project meetings also act as stand-ups for team updates and any other discussions / demos to demonstrate completed work and as a forum for helping to remove team blockers.
- Volunteers from the projects form sub-teams around given tasks, epics and stories. Sub-teams own their own deliverables, and method of delivery, from start to finish.
- Teams self organise for completion of tasks within a given sprint(s), including appointing / aligning with the [Project Operations Manager](docs/open-roles/project-operations-manager.md) to help coordinate the team's delivery.
- Sub-teams swarm around their tasks, epics and stories with self-organised team sessions at the discretion and independent management of the team.
- Sub-teams collectively review and approve their own work, with final review and approval done at end of sprint demos, with the merge performed by project maintainers teams - @finos/cloud-cert-maintainers
- High level planning of the Compliant Financial Infrastructure roadmap happens quarterly, where the next quarter, half and year is reviewed and broken down into sprint priorities.
- Ad-hoc requests for help are made to the Compliant Financial Infrastructure Project Maintainers team which can be tagged using @finos/compliant-financial-infrastructure-maintainers and @finos/open-compliance-cdmc-maintainers

## <a name="community">Community Contributions and Pull Requests</a>

- Pull Requests and Issues raised by the FINOS Community are automatically assigned to maintainers and allocated to project backlogs for sprint prioritisation at the next scheduled sprint planning session.
- Critical Pull Requests and Issues are allocated to project teams for immediate fulfilment at the discretion of the project maintainers.

## <a name="reviews">Asynchronous Pull Request and Code Reviews</a>
